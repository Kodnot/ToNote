# ToNote
## Overview
Unified TODO &amp; Note taking platform

Keep all your notes and TODOS well organized and all in one place!

This app can help you stay organised and always prepared. Keep all your notes and related tasks in one place, simplifying your workflow and allowing you to focus on the actual work.

## Usage

Simply click Add button and your first note will appear. You can add
tasks, write a description for them. Uncompleted tasks will stay in red
color, but if you are not lazy and complete those tasks in time, you
can proudly click check box next to your task and it will turn green.
All your changes are autosaved, so no need to worry about losing progress!

Also, if you don't like your workspace becoming crowded, it is possible
to delete a created note.

Note organization can easily be achieved by using tags - you can add tags to a note, remove them and most importantly filter notes by tags so that only the relevant information is displayed. You can also filter notes directly by their names, selecting only particular notes to display.

If you don't care about your notes and simply want a quick glance at what work you still have to do, you can switch over to the TODOs tab, where only all the todo items are displayed. These can be filtered by tag as well!

Finally, to make sure that you don't loose your data or to move your notes between computers, you can use the import/export functionality.

## Shortcuts

Our application provides multiple shortcuts to ensure a comfortable workflow.

* Use ctrl + Plus/Minus to easily navigate between textboxes and todos.
* Alt + shift + backspace can be used to immediately delete a textbox/todo, even if it still contains text.
* You can also create a note or todo without even moving your mouse! Simply
type /note or /todo into text box and newly created entry will appear.
